\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
\label{cha:acknowledgment}

First I would like to thank the head of our group Armando Rastelli for offering me this position and for making sure to always have an open ear, no matter how busy he was at the moment.
I would also like to thank Christian Schimpf for taking the role as my unofficial supervisor.
I can not think of anyone who would have fulfilled it better than him.
Thanks belongs to most of my group members but I want to especially highlight Marcus Reindl and Daniel Huber who granted me the biggest support. 
Further, I would like to thank Susanne Schwind for solving every administrative issue that came along my way.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my parents for supporting every goal I have ever pursued in my life and of course Sabrina for more reasons than I could ever possibly list.
