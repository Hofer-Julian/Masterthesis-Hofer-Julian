\section{Introduction and motivation}


The Fabry-Pérot interferometer is an optical resonator developed by Charles Fabry and Alfred Pérot.
An incoming light beam will only be transmitted through the resonator consisting of two semi-transparent mirrors if it fulfils the resonance condition.\cite{kaldewey_coherent_2017}

Resolve QD emission line.



\section{Theory}


\subsection{Resonator losses}
For the following discussion of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer, a two-mirror-resonator with the reflecting surfaces facing each other and air as medium in between is assumed.
The theoretical foundation is provided by the work of \textcite{ismail_fabry-perot_2016}.

The time the light needs for one roundtrip is given by
\begin{equation}
t_{RT} = \frac{2l}{c}
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the geometrical length of the resonator and $c$ is the speed of light in air. 

The photon-decay time $\tau_c$ of the interferometer is then given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\tau_c} = - \frac{\ln(R_1 \cdot R_2)}{t_{RT}}
\end{equation}
where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the corresponding intensity reflectivities of the mirrors.

The number of photons at frequency $\nu$ inside the resonator is described by the differential rate equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \varphi(t) = - \frac{1}{\tau_c}\varphi(t).
\end{equation}
With a number $\varphi_s$ of photons at $t=0$ the integration gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon-decay}
\varphi(t)=\varphi_s e^{-t/\tau_c}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Resonance frequencies, free spectral range and spectral line shapes}
The round-trip phase shift at frequency $\nu$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:round-trip-phase-shift-phi}
2 \phi(\nu) = 2 \pi \nu t_{RT} = 2 \pi \nu \frac{2l}{c}
\end{equation}
where $\phi(\nu)$ is the single-pass phase shift between the mirrors.

Resonances are visible for frequencies $\nu$ at which the light interferes constructively after one round trip.
Two adjacent resonance frequencies differ in their round trip phase shift by $2 \pi$.
Hence, the free spectral range $\Delta \nu_{FSR}$, the frequency difference between two adjacent resonance frequencies, can be calculated from equation~\eqref{eq:round-trip-phase-shift}
\begin{align}
2\Delta\phi_{FSR} = 2\pi \\
\Rightarrow 2\pi\Delta\nu_{FSR}\frac{2l}{c} = 2\pi\\
\label{eq:free-spectral-range}
\Rightarrow \Delta\nu_{FSR} = \frac{c}{2l}
\end{align}

According to equation~\eqref{eq:photon-decay} the number of photons decay with the photon-decay time $\tau_c$. With $E_{q,s}$ representing the initial amplitude, the electric field at $\nu_q$ can is given by
\begin{equation}
E_q(t) = 
\begin{cases}
E_{q,s} \cdot e^{i2\pi\nu_qt} \cdot e^{-t/(2\tau_c)} &  t \geq 0 \\
0 &  t < 0
\end{cases}
.
\end{equation}
The Fourier transformation of the electric field can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{E}_q(\nu) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty E_q(t)e^{-i2\pi\nu t}dt = E_q(t) \int_{0}^\infty e^{.[1/(2\tau_c)+i2\pi(\nu-\nu_q)]t}dt = E_{q,s} \frac{1}{(2\tau_c)^{-1}+i2\pi(\nu-\nu_q)}.
\end{equation}
The normalized spectral line shape per unit frequency is then given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:round-trip-phase-shift}
\tilde{\gamma_q}(\nu)&=\frac{1}{\tau_c}\left|\frac{\tilde{E}_q(\nu)}{E_{q,s}}\right|^2=\frac{1}{\tau_c}\left|\frac{1}{(2\tau_c)^{-1}+i2\pi(\nu-\nu_q)}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{\tau_c}\frac{1}{(2\tau_c)^{-2}+4\pi^2(\nu-\nu_q)^2} \\
&=\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1/(4\pi\tau_c)}{1/(4\pi\tau_c)^2+(\nu-\nu_q)^2}
\end{align}
with $\int \tilde{\gamma_q}(\nu)d\nu=1$.
By defining the full-width-at-half-maximum linewidth (FWHM) $\Delta\nu_c$ we get
\begin{equation}
\Delta \nu_c = \frac{1}{2\pi\tau_c} \Rightarrow \tilde{\gamma_q}(\nu) = \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\Delta \nu_c/2}{\left(\Delta\nu_c/2\right)^2+\left(\nu-\nu_q\right)^2}
\end{equation}
By normalizing the Lorentzian lines so that the peak is at unity we finally obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lorentzian}
\gamma_{q,L}(\nu)=\frac{\pi}{2}\Delta\nu_c\tilde{\gamma_q}(\nu)=\frac{(\Delta\nu_c)^2}{\left(\Delta \nu_c\right)^2+4\left(\nu-\nu_q\right)^2}
\end{equation}
with $\gamma_{q,L}(\nu_q)=1$.
\subsection{Airy distribution of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/fabry-perot/Schematic_of_the_Fabry-Perot_interferometer}
	\caption[Fabry-Pérot interferometer with electric field mirror reflectivities $r_1$ and $r_2$]{Fabry-Pérot interferometer with electric field mirror reflectivities $r_1$ and $r_2$. Indicated in this figure are the electric fields resulting from an incoming $E_{inc}$, the reflected field $E_{refl,1}$ and transmitted field $E_{laun}$. $E_{circ}$ and $E_{circ,b}$ circulate inside the resonator, resulting in $E_{RT}$ after one round-trip. $E_{back}$ is the backwards transmitted field.\cite{noauthor_fabryperot_nodate}}
	\label{fig:schematicofthefabry-perotinterferometer}
\end{figure}
The response of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer is calculated with the circulating-field approach~\cite{ismail_fabry-perot_2016}, where a steady-state is assumed.
$E_{circ}$ is the result of $E_{laun}$ interfering with $E_{RT}$.
$E_{laun}$ is the transmission of the incoming light $E_{inc}$ and $E_{RT}$ is $E_{circ}$ after one round-trip in the resonator, i.e., after the outcoupling losses of mirror 1 and 2.
Therefore, the field $E_{circ}$ can be calculated from $E_{launch}$ by
\begin{equation}
E_{circ} = E_{laun} + E_{RT} = E_{laun} + r_1 r_2 e^{-i 2 \phi} E_{circ} \Rightarrow \frac{E_{circ}}{E_{laun}} = \frac{1}{1 - r_1 r_2 e^{-i 2 \phi}}
\end{equation}
where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the electric-field reflectivities of mirror 1 and 2.

The generic Airy distribution considers only light inside the mirrors and is defined as
\begin{equation}
A_{circ} = \frac{I_{circ}}{I_{laun}} = \frac{|E_{circ}|^2}{|E_{laun}|^2} = \frac{1}{\left|1 - r_1 r_2 e^{-i2\phi}\right|^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1-\sqrt{R_1 R_2}\right)^2 + 4\sqrt{R_1 R_2} \sin^2(\phi)}
\end{equation}
by using
\begin{align*}
\left|1-r_1 r_2 e^{-i2\phi}\right|^2 &= \left|1- r_1 r_2 \cos(2\phi) + i r_1 r_2 \sin(2\phi)\right|^2 = \left[1-r_1 r_2 \cos(2\phi)\right]^2 + r_1^2 r_2^2 \sin^2(2\phi) \\
 &=1+R_1 R_2 - 2\sqrt{R_1 R_2} \cos(2\phi) = \left(1-\sqrt{R_1 R_2}\right)^2 + 4 \sqrt{R_1 R_2} \sin^2(\phi)
\end{align*}
and additionally $R_i = r_i^2$ and $\cos(2\phi) = 1 -2\sin^2(\phi)$.

Commonly, light is sent through the Fabry-Pérot resonator. Therefore the following sections will use the Airy distribution $A'_{trans}$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A-trans}
A'_{trans} = \frac{I_{trans}}{I_{inc}} = \frac{I_{circ} \cdot (1 - R_2)}{I_{laun} / (1 - R_1)} = (1-R_1)(1-R_2)A_{circ} = \frac{(1-R_1)(1-R_2)}{\left(1-\sqrt{R_1R_2}\right)^2+4\sqrt{R_1R_2}\sin^2(\phi)}
\end{equation}
$A'_{trans}$ is displayed in figure~\ref{fig:airydistributionofafabry-perotinterferometer} for $R_1=R_2$. The peak value at one of its resonance frequencies calculates as follows
\begin{equation}
A'_{trans} = \frac{(1-R_1)(1-R_2)}{\left(1-\sqrt{R_1R_2}\right)^2} \stackrel{R_1=R_2}{=} 1. 
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/fabry-perot/Airy_distribution_of_a_Fabry-Perot_interferometer}
	\caption{Airy distribution $A'_{trans}$ as described in equation~\eqref{eq:A-trans} compared to the Lorentzian lines  $\gamma_{q,L}$ as described in equation~\eqref{eq:lorentzian}}
	\label{fig:airydistributionofafabry-perotinterferometer}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Airy linewidth and finesse}
The airy linewidth is defined as the FWHM of $A'_{trans}$. It can be set in relation with the free spectral range $\Delta \nu_{FSR}$ and the mirror reflectivities as follows.

$A'_{trans}$ decreases to half of its peak value at $A'_{trans}(v_q) / 2$ when the phase shift $\phi$ changes by the amount $\Delta\phi$ so that the denominator of $A'_{trans}$ in equation~\eqref{eq:A-trans}  is twice as big
\begin{align}
\left(1-\sqrt{R_1R_2}\right)^2=4\sqrt{R_1R_2}\sin^2(\Delta\phi) \\
\label{eq:phase-shift-R}
\Rightarrow \Delta\phi=\arcsin\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{R_1R_2}}{2\sqrt[4]{R_1R_2}}\right)
\end{align}
With equation~\eqref{eq:round-trip-phase-shift-phi} and \eqref{eq:free-spectral-range}, the phase shift can be expressed as
\begin{align}
\phi &= \frac{\pi \nu}{\Delta \nu_{FSR}} \\
\label{eq:phase-shift-nu}
\Rightarrow \Delta \phi &= \frac{\pi (\Delta \nu_{Airy}/2)}{\Delta \nu_{FSR}}.
\end{align}
Therefore, with equation~\eqref{eq:phase-shift-R} and \eqref{eq:phase-shift-nu} the FWHM linewdith is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta \nu_{Airy} = \Delta \nu_{FSR}\frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{R_1R_2}}{2\sqrt[4]{R_1R_2}}\right).
\end{equation}

The finesse of the Airy distribution of a Fabry-Pérot interferometer is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:f-airy}
F_{Airy} := \frac{\Delta \nu_{FSR}}{\Delta \nu_{Airy}} = \frac{\pi}{2}\left[\arcsin\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{R_1R_2}}{2\sqrt[4]{R_1R_2}}\right)\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
and is therefore only dependent on the mirror reflectivities $R_1$ and $R_2$.

The Airy finesse is the determining property when it comes to the spectral resolution of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer. This can be made visible by comparing its message with the Taylor criterion for the resolution of two adjacent peaks.
The Taylor criterion proposes that two spectral lines are resolvable when the separation of the maxima is greater than the FWHM. As displayed in figure~\ref{fig:airyfinesseofafabry-perotinterferometer}, the Airy finesse is equal to the number of Airy distributions originating from light at certain frequencies $\nu_m$ which do not overlap at a point higher than half of their maxima.
Hence, the Airy finesse describes the spectral resolution in a way that is consistent with the Taylor criterion.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/fabry-perot/Airy_finesse_of_a_Fabry-Perot_interferometer}
	\caption[Demonstration of the physical meaning of the Airy finesse $F_{Airy}$]{Demonstration of the physical meaning of the Airy finesse $F_{Airy}$.
		The coloured lines are Airy distributions created by light at distinct frequencies $\nu_m$, while scanning the resonator length. When the light occurs at frequencies $\nu_m = \nu_q+m\Delta \nu_{Airy}$, the adjacent Airy distributions are separated from each other by $\nu_{Airy}$, therefore fulfilling the Taylor criterion.
		Since in this example $F_{airy}=6$  exactly six peaks fit inside the free spectral range.
		As can be seen in the figure the Airy finesse $F_{Airy}$ quantifies the maximum number of peaks that can be resolved. ~\cite{noauthor_fabryperot_nodate}}

\subsection{Gaussian beam}
\label{subsec:gaussian-beam}

In this subsection, light beams are described by the wave picture according to \textcite{meschede_optik_2008}.
They fulfil the Maxwell equations and therefore their electric field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)$  fulfils the wave equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wave-equation}
\left(\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial t^2}\right)\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = 0.
\end{equation}
Along the propagation direction $z$ a light beam behaves similarly to a plane wave with constant amplitude $A_0$ which is a known solution to the wave equation~\eqref{eq:wave-equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:plain-wave}
E(z,t)=A_0e^{-i(\omega t - kz)}.
\end{equation}
However, far from its source light is expected to behave like a spherical wave
\begin{equation}
E(\mathbf{r},t)=A_0\frac{e^{-i(\omega t -\mathbf{kr})}}{|\mathbf{kr}|}.
\end{equation}
To get a better understanding of the propagation of light, only paraxial (near the z-axis) parts  of the spherical wave are considered.
Additionally, the wave is split into its longitudinal (z-axis) part and it transversal part and beams with axial symmetry are assumed, which only depend on a transversal coordinate $\rho$.
Under these circumstances $\mathbf{kr}$ can be replaced with $kr$ and because of $\rho<<r,z$ the Fresnel approximation can be applied:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:e-field-after-fresnel-approximation}
E(\mathbf{r})=\frac{A(\mathbf{r})}{|\mathbf{kr}|}e^{i\mathbf{kr}}\simeq\frac{A(z,\rho)}{kz}\exp\left(i\frac{k\rho^2}{2z}\right)e^{ikz}
\end{equation}
with $r = \sqrt{z^2+\rho^2} \simeq z+\rho^2/2z$.

Equation~\eqref{eq:e-field-after-fresnel-approximation} resembles the plain wave in equation~\eqref{eq:plain-wave}, with the spacial phase transversal modulated by $\exp(ik\rho^2/2z)$.
Another spherical wave solution can be obtained by applying the following replacement ($z_0$ is a real number)
\begin{equation}
z \rightarrow q(z)=z-iz_0.
\end{equation}
Thereby, the fundamental (or TEM$_{00}$) Gaussian mode has been constructed
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fundamental-gaussian-mode}
E(z,\rho)\simeq\frac{A_0}{kq(z)}\exp\left(i\frac{k\rho^2}{2q(z)}\right)e^{ikz}.
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/fabry-perot/gaussian-mode-near-beam-waist}
	\caption[A Gaussian beam near its beam waist.]
	{A Gaussian beam near its beam waist.
		Near the center they resemble plan wave fronts, while outside they converge towards spherical wave fronts.
		They Rayleighzone is shaded at the lower part of the figure.\cite{meschede_optik_2008}}
	\label{fig:gaussian-mode-near-beam-waist}
\end{figure}

The electrical and magnetical fields of gauss modes are transversal to its propagation direction.
These waveforms are called transversal elctrical and magnetic modes with indices $(m,n)$.
Its fundamental solution is the TEM$_{00}$-Mode, which is the most important one and will therefore be examined in more detail in the rest of this subsection.

By executing the replacement $q(z)\rightarrow z-iz_0$ explicitly the equation~\eqref{eq:fundamental-gaussian-mode} can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{q(z)}=\frac{z+iz_0}{z^2+z_0^2}=\frac{1}{R(z)}+i\frac{2}{k\omega^2(z)},
\end{equation}
with new variables $z_0$, $R(z)$ and $\omega(z)$ being introduced.
With the decomposition of the Fresnel factors into real and imaginary part, two factors can be identified: one complex phase factor, which describes the curvature of the wavefronts and a real factor, which describes the envelope of the beam.
Therefore, the exponential in equation~\eqref{eq:fundamental-gaussian-mode} becomes
\begin{equation}
\exp\left(i\frac{k\rho^2}{2q(z)}\right) \rightarrow \exp\left(i\frac{k\rho^2}{2R(z)}\right)\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\rho}{\omega(z)}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}
For the following description of gauss modes the following  parameters have to be introduced
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Evolving radius of curvature} $R(z)$:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:radius-wavefronts}
	R(z)=z(1+(z_0/z)^2)
	\end{equation}
	\item \textbf{Beam waist} $2\omega_0$:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:beam-waist}
	\omega_0^2=\lambda z_0/\pi
	\end{equation}
	The beam waist $2\omega_0$ or beam radius $\omega_0$ describe the smallest  beam cross section at $z=0$.
	If the wave propagates inside a medium with the refractive index $n$, $\lambda$ has to be replaced with $\lambda/n$.
	The cross section of the beam waist  is then $\omega_0^2=\lambda z_0/(\pi n)$.
\end{itemize}
A Gaussian beam can be completely characterized at every point $z$ on the beam axis either with the parameter couple $(\omega_0, z_0)$ or alternatively with the real and imaginary part of $q(z)$.
The parameters of the Gaussian beam are transformed by linear operations, which coefficients are identical to those from geometrical optics
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ABCD-rule}
q_{out}=\frac{A q_{in} + B}{C q_{in} + D}
\end{equation}
with the parameters $A, B, C, D$ determined by the optical element transforming the Gaussian beam described by $q_{in}$.

\subsection{Higher Gauss modes}
The wave equation~\eqref{eq:wave-equation} can be simplified, by only allowing monochromatic waves with harmonic time dependence
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \operatorname{Re}\left(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})e^{-i\omega t}\right).
\end{equation}
With $\omega^2=c^2\mathbf{k}^2$, the \textit{Helmholtz equation} can be deduced, which only depends on the location \textbf{r}
\begin{equation}
\left(\nabla^2+\mathbf{k}^2\right)\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})=0.
\end{equation}
In favour of a formal treatment of the Gaussian modes, the Helmholtz equation is splitted into its transversal and longitudinal contribution,
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2+k^2=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} + \nabla_T^2+k^2
\quad\mathrm{with}\quad 
\nabla_T^2=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial}{\partial y^2} \ ,
\end{equation}
and apply it on the electric field of equation~\eqref{eq:e-field-after-fresnel-approximation}.
It is assumed that the amplitude $A$ only changes slowly in the order of the wavelength,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial z} A = A' \ll kA \ ,
\end{equation}
which allows the approximation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} A e^{ik\rho^2 /(2z)} \frac{e^{ikz}}{kz} \simeq (2ikA'-k^2A)e^{ik\rho^2/(2z)}\frac{e^{ikz}}{kz} \ ,
\end{equation}
and results in the \textit{paraxial Helmholtz equation},
\begin{equation}
\left(\nabla_T^2+2ik\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)A(\rho, z) = 0.
\end{equation}
The fundamental solution is the TEM$_{00}$ mode in equation~\eqref{eq:fundamental-gaussian-mode}. Examples of higher modes can be found in figure~\ref{fig:gauss-modes-higher-order}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mode matching and spatial filtering}

One fundamental challenge of Fabry Pérot interferometry is how to efficiently couple an incident beam of light into a given mode of the resonator.
The following discussion is based on the work of \textcite{yariv_photonics:_2007} and \textcite{meschede_optik_2008}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/fabry-perot/excitation-of-transverse-mode}
	\caption{Incident monochromatic beam of light exciting transverse mode $m$, $n$ of a resonator~\cite{yariv_photonics:_2007}}
	\label{fig:excitation-of-transverse-mode}
\end{figure}

In accordance with figure~\ref{fig:excitation-of-transverse-mode}, an input beam $E_{in}$ propagates into the resonator and potentially excite its modes $E_{mn}(x,y)$, where $m$, $n$ are the transverse mode integers of the Gaussian beam of the optical resonator.
Since $E_{mn}(x,y)$ describes a complete orthogonal set of wavefunctions they satisfy
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:complete-set-mn-modes}
\iint E_{mn}(x,y) E^*_{m'n'}(x,y) dx dy = 0 \quad \mathrm{unless} \ m=m' \ \mathrm{and} \ n=n'.
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:superposition-mn-modes}
E_{in}(x,y) = \sum_{mn}a_{mn}E_{mn}(x,y)
\end{equation}
where $a_{mn}$ are constants.
By multiplying both sides of equation~\eqref{eq:superposition-mn-modes} with $E_{mn}^*$, integrating over the whole $x$-$y$-plane and using equation~\eqref{eq:complete-set-mn-modes}, the following expression can be obtained
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:a-mn}
a_{mn}=\frac{\iint E_{in}(x,y)E^*_{mn}(x,y) dx dy}{\iint E_{mn}(x,y)E^*_{mn}(x,y) dx dy}
\end{equation}
The efficiency of coupling an incident field into a spatial mode $E_{mn}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coupling-efficiency-first}
\eta_{mn}=\frac{\textrm{Power coupled into mode } mn}{\textrm{Total incident power}}=
\frac{\iint \left|a_{mn} E_{mn}(x,y)\right|^2 dx dy}{\iint \left|E_{in}(x,y)\right|^2 dx dy}.
\end{equation}
By inserting equation~\eqref{eq:a-mn} into equation~\eqref{eq:coupling-efficiency-first} the following expression can be obtained
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:coupling-efficiency-second}
\eta_{mn}= \frac{\left|\iint E_{in}(x,y)E^*_{mn}(x,y) dx dy\right|^2}{\iint \left|E_{in}(x,y)\right|^2 dx dy \cdot \iint \left|E_{mn}(x,y)\right|^2 dx dy}.
\end{equation}
From equation~\eqref{eq:coupling-efficiency-second} can be deduced, that for an input beam with the \textit{same} spatial dependency as the mode to be excited
\begin{equation}
E_{in}(x,y) \sim E_{mn}(x,y)
\end{equation}
all of the incident power goes into $E_{mn}$, i.e. $\eta_{mn}=1$ and all other $\eta_{m'n'}$ are zero.
Usually the fundamental TEM$_{00}$ mode is desired and equation~\eqref{eq:coupling-efficiency-second} implies that a pure Gaussian beam excites only the fundamental mode and the interferometer will then irradiate a pure Gaussian beam as well. In practise, additional measures are necessary such as matching the radius of curvature by Gaussian beam focusing.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/fabry-perot/gaussian-beam-focusing}
	\caption{Incoming Gaussian beam described by $q_{in}$ transformed by a lens into a Gaussian beam described by $q_{out}$. The parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$ describe the radii of the two mirrors.}
	\label{fig:gaussian-beam-focusing}
\end{figure}

In order to match the radius of curvature of the incoming Gaussian beam with the radius of curvature of the resonator a lens is inserted as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:gaussian-beam-focusing}. Light with a beam waist of $\omega_{01}$ gets focused into the resonator. Transformations by thin lenses can be described with the ABCD-rule introduced in subsection~\ref{subsec:gaussian-beam}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B \\
C & D
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
\frac{-1}{f} & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with $f$ as the wavelength of the lens.
The incoming beam described by $q_{in}$ is transformed by the lens into a beam described by $q_{out}$ according to equation~\eqref{eq:beam-waist} and \eqref{eq:ABCD-rule}
\begin{equation}
q_{in} = z + i \frac{\pi n \omega_{0,in}^2}{\lambda} \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad
q_{out} = \frac{q_{in}}{q_{in} \cdot \frac{-1}{f} + 1} =  z + i \frac{\pi n \omega_{0,out}^2}{\lambda}
\end{equation}
with $n\approx 1$ for air. Together with equation~\eqref{eq:beam-waist} to following relation can be deduced
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:w-o-out}
\omega_{0,out}^2 = \frac{\omega_{0,in}^2}{\left(1-\frac{z}{f}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\pi \omega_{0,in}}{\lambda f}\right)^2}
\end{equation}
The radii of curvature have to match.
For given mirrors (described by $R_{mirror}$) and lens (described by $f$) the input beam waist has to be adjusted according to equation~\eqref{eq:radius-wavefronts} and \eqref{eq:beam-waist} 
\begin{align}
R_{mirror} \stackrel{!}{=} R_{gauss}(z= l/2)\\
R_{mirror} \stackrel{!}{=} \frac{l}{2} \left(1+\left(\frac{2z_{0,out}}{l}\right)^2\right) \\
\label{eq:R-mirror-1}
R_{mirror} \stackrel{!}{=} \frac{l}{2} \left(1+\left(\frac{2\omega_{0,out}^2 \pi}{l \lambda}\right)^2\right).
\end{align}
Inserting equation~\eqref{eq:R-mirror-1} into equation~\eqref{eq:w-o-out} results in the condition for mode matching
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:R-mirror-2}
R_{mirror} = \frac{l}{2} \left(1+\left(\frac{2 \omega_{0,in}^2 \pi}{\left(\left(1-\frac{z}{f}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\pi \omega_{0,in}}{\lambda f}\right)^2\right)l \lambda}\right)^2\right).
\end{equation}

One way to further suppress higher modes is \textit{spatial filtering}. It can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:gauss-modes-higher-order} that the effective area of a mode increases with its order $(m, n)$. Figure~\ref{fig:spatial-filtering-of-gauss-modes} shows one way to suppress higher modes consisting of a focusing lens and a pin hole which diameter TEM$_{00}$ mode.

\subsection{Confocal setup}
\label{subsec:confocal-setup}

If the incoming beam would represent a perfect TEM$_{00}$ mode, spatial filtering would not be necessary and mode matching wouldn't have to be done as precise. Unfortunately, this can not always be guaranteed and mode matching plus spatial filtering is tedious and error prone. Arranging the mirrors of a Fabry Pérot interferometry into a confocal arrangement reduces the need for these measures.
By giving up the ability to choose different free spectral ranges with a given pair of mirrors, the confocal setup liberates from mode matching considerations as the cavity is mode degenerate, i.e the frequency of certain axial and transverse cavity modes are the same.
The following discussion is based on \textcite{hercher_spherical_1968}.

A quasi-monochromatic beam of wavelength $\lambda_0$ is composed of transverse modes TEM$_{\textrm{mnq}}$, where the subscripts $m$ and $n$ denote the amplitude distribution of the normal mode on a surface of constant phase and $q$ the number of axial modes inside the resonator.
Each of these modes resonates for mirror separations satisfying
\begin{equation}
l = \frac{\lambda_0}{2}\{q + \left(1 + m + n\right) \cos^{-1}\left[(1-l/b_1)(1-l/b_2)\right]^{1/2}\}
\end{equation}
where the parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$ describe the radii of the two mirrors as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:gaussian-beam-focusing}.

For the confocal setup $l=b_1=b_2$ which justifies the approximation
\begin{equation}
l \approx \frac{\lambda_0}{2} \left[q + \left(1+m+n\right)\right].
\end{equation}
The modes resonate at mirror separations of either
\begin{align}
l = \frac{\lambda_0}{2}(p+1) \qquad p&\in\mathbb{N} \textrm{ and } (m+n) \textrm{ even,} \\
l = \frac{\lambda_0}{2}(p) \qquad p&\in\mathbb{N} \textrm{ and } (m+n) \textrm{ odd.}
\end{align}
If mode matching is not executed, it can be assumed that the incoming beam consists of an approximately equal number of even and odd transverse modes.
The resonance cavity length $l$ does not depend on $n$,$m$ and $q$ anymore but only on one integer $p$. The transversal modes are degenerate and fulfil
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:confocal-degenerate}
l = \frac{\lambda_0 p}{2}.	
\end{equation}
It can be additionally concluded from equation~\eqref{eq:confocal-degenerate}, that a change of $\lambda_0/2$ in the mirror separation scans through one free spectral range.
\section{Simulation}

The goal in building up a scanning Fabry Pérot interferometry is to resolve features of the emission spectra of GaAs quantum dots described in chapter~\ref{chapter:quantum-dot}. More specifically, it is intended to resolve the shape of the zero-phonon line and the phonon side band.
Equation~\ref{eq:f-airy} shows that the finesse is constant for a given pair of mirrors.
When the spectrum to be resolved is broad a higher free spectral range $\Delta \nu_{FSR}$ has to be chosen, under the loss of resolution.
When the spectrum contains fine details which need to be resolved a lower $\nu_{Airy}$ has to be chosen, which results in a lower free spectral range $\Delta \nu_{FSR}$.
Hence, the thin zero-phonon line and the broad phonon side band can not be resolved with the same setup.
Instead, the mirror distances have to be adjusted and in the confocal setup discussed in subsection~\ref{subsec:confocal-setup} the mirrors have to be exchanged as well.
