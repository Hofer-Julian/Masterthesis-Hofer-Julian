\section{Fabry-Pérot-Interferometer}

The Fabry-Pérot-Interferometer is an optical resonator developed by Charles Fabry and Alfred Pérot.
An incoming light beam will only be transmitted through the resonator consisting of two semi-transparent mirrors if it fulfils the resonance condition.

But what then?
