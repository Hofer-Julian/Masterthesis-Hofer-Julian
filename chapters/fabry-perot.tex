\section{Theory}

\subsection{Gaussian Beam}

Dot-Spectra in far field is (TEM$_{00}$).

\subsection{Fabry-Pérot Interferometer}

The Fabry-Pérot interferometer is an optical resonator developed by Charles Fabry and Alfred Pérot.
An incoming light beam will only be transmitted through the resonator consisting of two semi-transparent mirrors if it fulfils the resonance condition.\cite{kaldewey_coherent_2017}

\subsection{Resonator losses}
For the following discussion of the Fabry-Pérot interferometer, a two-mirror-resonator with the reflecting surfaces facing each other and air as medium in between is assumed. The time the light needs for one roundtrip is then given by ~\cite{ismail_fabry-perot_2016}
\begin{equation}
t_{RT} = \frac{2l}{c}
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the geometrical length of the resonator and $c$ is the speed of light in air. 

The photon-decay time $\tau_c{\nu}$ of the interferometer is then given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\tau_c} = - \frac{\ln(R_1 \cdot R_2)}{t_{RT}}
\end{equation}
where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the corresponding intensity reflectivities of the mirrors.

The number of photons at frequency $\nu$ inside the resonator is described by the differential rate equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \varphi(t) = - \frac{1}{\tau_c}\varphi(t).
\end{equation}
With a number $\varphi_s$ of photons at $t=0$ the integration gives
\begin{equation}
\varphi(t)=\varphi_s e^{-t/\tau_c}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Resonance frequencies and free spectral range}
The round-trip phase shift at frequency $\nu$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:round-trip-phase-shift}
2 \phi(\nu) = 2 \pi \nu t_{RT} = 2 \pi \nu \frac{2l}{c}
\end{equation}
where $\phi(\nu)$ is the single-pass phase shift between the mirrors.

Resonances are visible for frequencies $\nu$ at which the light interferes constructively after one round trip.
Two adjacent resonance frequencies differ in their round trip phase shift by $2 \pi$.
Hence, the free spectral range $\Delta \nu_{FSR}$, the frequency difference between two adjacent resonance frequencies, can be calculated from equation~\eqref{eq:round-trip-phase-shift}
\begin{align}
2\Delta\phi = 2\pi \\
\Rightarrow 2\pi\Delta\nu_{FSR}\frac{2l}{c} = 2\pi\\
\Rightarrow \Delta\nu_{FSR} = \frac{c}{2l}
\end{align}
