\chapter{Droplet etched gallium arsenide quantum dots}
\label{chapter:quantum-dot}

\section{Fabrication and optical properties}

Quantum dots (\acs{QD}) are nanostructures which confine the motion of electrons and holes in all three-dimensional spatial dimensions.
Confinement results in discrete energy levels, which is why \acp{QD} are sometimes referred to as \textit{artificial atoms}.
Additionally, they provide potentially suitable implementations of qbits, the basic unit of quantum information.
The discussion in this section is based on the PhD thesis of \textcite{huber_gaas_2019}.

Gallium arsenide quantum dots investigated within this master's thesis are grown by \ac{MBE} with the self-assembled nanodrill technology described in the work of \textcite{wang_nanoholes_2007}.
As displayed in figure~\ref{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}(a) the \ac{Al} forms droplets on AlGaAs after evaporation.
The \ac{Al} reacts with AlGaAs, which leads into nanoholes etched into te surface.
Under optimal conditions, these nanoholes are highly symmetric as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}(b). 
This results into \ac{QD} with high in-plane symmetry.
The next step is the annealing process in which \ac{GaAs} is deposited to fill the nanoholes.
The \ac{QD} is finalized by capping the layer with AlGaAs acting as top barrier.

Compared to the band gap of the host material Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As of \SI{1.92}{\electronvolt} at room temperature, the core of the \ac{QD}, \ac{GaAs}, has a band gap of only \SI{1.42}{\electronvolt} at room temperature.
This energy difference between the band gaps and nanosized dimensions of the \ac{QD} are responsible for the 3D confinement and the type-I band alignment depicted in figure~\ref{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}(c).
This thesis focuses on optical transitions between the first energy level in the \ac{CB} and the \ac{VB}, often called the s-shell.
The carriers are electrons $e^-$ and the holes left behind $h^+$.
These are fermions and can therefore only up to two of them can, in accordance with Pauli's exclusion principle, occupy a single energy state.
Electrons and holes are strongly localized inside the \ac{QD} and interact with each other by Coulomb interaction.
This leads to multi-particle complexes with the most fundamental being the \acf{X}, a bound state of an electron and a hole.
A fully occupied s-shell, can be described by the quasiparticle called \acf{XX}.

In a \ac{QD} polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated via a biexciton-exciton cascade~\cite{stevenson_semiconductor_2006}, illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:biexciton-exciton-cascade}.
$\ket{XX}$ forms a full shell, which means that the total angular momentum projection along the quantization axis of the \ac{XX} complex sums up to $M=0$.
After exciting the \ac{QD} into the $\ket{XX}$ state (e.g. by optical pumping) it decays by spontaneous recombination of an electron-hole-pair accompanied by the emission of a single photon into the $\ket{X}$ state.
The two-dipole allowed radiative transitions lead to only two possible $\ket{X}$ states:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\ket{-1}$ under emission of a right-circularly-polarized photon $\ket{r}$ 
	\item $\ket{+1}$ under emission of a left-circularly-polarized photon $\ket{l}$ 
\end{itemize}
$\ket{-1}$ and $\ket{+1}$ are degenerate in energy and decay into the groundstate $\ket{G}$ under emission of $\ket{l}$ and $\ket{r}$, respectively.

\section{Fine structure splitting}
Fine structure splitting (\acs{FSS}) in a \ac{QD} describes the energy splitting between the two possible bright $\ket{X}$ states.
In GaAs it originates from the exchange interaction between electrons and holes.~\cite{bayer_fine_2002}.

In figure~\ref{fig:qd-energy-levels-fss} the $\ket{XX}$ decay path with splitted $\ket{X}$ eigenstates is shown.  $\ket{XX}$ exhibit no splitting as the angular momentum of the electrons and holes add to zero and therefore no exchange interaction occurs.
In figure~\ref{fig:fss-pol} photoluminescence spectra recorded with a linear polarizer are shown.

\section{Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband}
The excitonic emission of \ac{GaAs} \acp{QD} exhibit non-Lorentzian asymmetric broadening. As shown by \textcite{peter_phonon_2004} this side bands can be traced back to a coupling to acoustic phonons.
The discussion of \acp{PSB} is based on \textcite{friedrich_photochemical_1984} and  \textcite{peter_phonon_2004}.

Figure~\ref{fig:line-shape} displays a schematic representation of the \ac{ZPL} and \ac{PSB} absorption spectrum.
The intensity distribution between the two components depends strongly on temperature.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering

	\caption[Absorption line shape of an electronic excitation.]{Absorption line shape of an electronic excitation.
		The emission is mirrored at $\omega'$.}
	\label{fig:line-shape}
\end{figure}
To determine the frequency gap $\Delta$ the Franc-Condon principles are used.
They state that electronic transition between ground and excited state is much faster than the motion in the lattice.
Hence, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates $q_i$ during the energy transitions as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram}.
The transitions can be displayed as vertical arrows with the shorter arrow describing the \ac{ZPL} and the longer one describing the \ac{PSB}.
According to the Franc-Condon principles, the more the wave functions of two vibrational energy levels overlap, the likelier is the electronic transition between these two.
In the case of figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram} this occurs when the photon energy equals to the energy difference $E_1-E_0$ plus three quanta of vibrational energy $\hbar \Omega_i$.
The emission follows the same principle.

	\caption{Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband.~\cite{noauthor_zero-phonon_nodate}}
	\label{fig:zero-phonon-line-phonon-side-band}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram} and \ref{fig:lattice-modes} implicitly assume approximations in addition to the Franck-Condon principles.
The lattice vibrational mode has to be well described by a quantum harmonic oscillator.
Additionally, it is assumed that only the lowest lattice vibration is excited and that the harmonic oscillator potentials are equal in both states.
These preconditions are visible in the equally parabolic shaped potential wells and equally spaced phonon energy levels in figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram}.

The zero-phonon line is stronger than the phonon side band because of the superpositon of the lattice modes. Each lattice mode $m$ lead to a different energy difference $\hbar \Omega_m$ between phonons.
That is why the transitions with phonons result in a energy distribution and the zero-phonon transition add at the electronic origin $E_1 - E_0$.

The theoretical limit of the spectral range of the zero-phonon line for a GaAs quantum dot can be calculated with the time-energy uncertainty relation
\begin{equation}
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t = \frac{h}{2 \pi}
\end{equation}
This gives for typical lifetime of a GaAs quantum dot of $\Delta t = \SI{250}{\pico \second}$
\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \SI{2.64}{\micro \electronvolt}.
\end{equation}
The frequency uncertainty can be obtained through
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:planck-einstein}
\Delta \nu = \frac{\Delta E}{h}.
\end{equation}
The wavelength $\lambda$ relates to $\nu$ with the Planck-Einstein relation 
\begin{equation}
\lambda(\nu) = \frac{c}{\nu}
\end{equation}
and the wavelength uncertainty $\Delta \lambda$ can be approximated with a Taylor series around $\nu_0$
\begin{align}
\Delta \lambda = - \lambda'(\nu_0)\cdot \Delta \nu.
\end{align}
With equation~\eqref{eq:planck-einstein} and the center wavelength of the zero-phonon line $\lambda_{0}$ in table~\ref{tab:quantum-dot-emission} this gives
\begin{align}
\Delta \lambda &= \frac{c}{\nu_0^2} \cdot \Delta \nu = \frac{\lambda_0^2}{c}\cdot\Delta \nu\\
\label{eq:zero-phonon-theoretical-limit}
&\approx \SI{1.0}{\pico \metre}
\end{align}

The zero-phonon line is described with a Cauchy distribution
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{dot,zero}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\pi \cdot \Delta\lambda_{zero} \cdot 0.5 \left[1+\left(\frac{\lambda - \lambda_{0, zero}}{\Delta\lambda_{zero} \cdot 0.5}\right)^2\right]}
\end{equation}
with $\lambda_{0, zero}$ as the center wavelength and $\Delta\lambda_{zero}$ as the spectral range of the zero-phonon line.

The phonon side band is described with a Gauss distribution
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{dot,side}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\cdot\pi\cdot \Delta\lambda_{side}^2}}\cdot exp\left(-\frac{(\lambda - \lambda_{0, side})^2}{2\cdot \Delta\lambda_{side}^2}\right)
\end{equation}
with $\lambda_{0, side}$ as the center wavelength and $\Delta\lambda_{side}$ as the spectral range of the phonon side band.

\section{Optical excitation of a quantum dot}
In this section, the different ways of optically exciting \acp{QD} are discussed. It is based on the PhD thesis of \textcite{huber_gaas_2019} and the master's thesis of \textcite{schimpf_towards_2017}.
The excited state of a \ac{QD} can be populated in various ways.
A common way is the above-band excitation, depicted in figure~\ref{fig:optical-pumping-quantum-dot}(a).
Electrons are optically excited by a laser with energies above the band gap of the \acp{QD} host material Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As with $E_g = \SI{1.92}{\electronvolt}$ at room temperature.
Subsequently, the electrons are captured by the \acp{QD} and relax via phonon-scattering to the lowest energy level, the s-shell.
However, above-band excitation is not favourable for entangled photon generation, because of pronounced recapture processes~\cite{kuroda_symmetric_2013} and spin scattering processes~\cite{michler_single_2009}.
Additionally, indistinguishability of the emitted photons is reduced  because of carrier-relaxation-induced time-jitter and fluctuating electric fields.
As this team is interested in extracting entangled X/XX photon pairs, above-band is more than often not the best exciting technique of \ac{GaAs} \acp{QD}.
Resonant excitation of electron-hole pairs provides an alternative without the disadvantages of above-band excitation.
As shown in figure~\ref{fig:optical-pumping-quantum-dot}(b) this technique creates electron-hole-pairs directly in the s-shell.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/quantum-dot/optical-pumping-quantum-dot}
	\caption{Optical pumping of a QD by	(a) above-band excitation and (b) resonant excitation~\cite{huber_gaas_2019}}
	\label{fig:optical-pumping-quantum-dot}
\end{figure}
Due to dipole-selection rules, resonant population of the $\ket{XX}$ state requires a two-photon-absorption process.
Hereby, the energy of a femtosecond-pulse laser $E_p$ is tuned to exactly the half of the \ac{XX} energy with respect to the ground energy $E_{XX}$, as sketched in figure~\ref{fig:qd-resonant}.
Because of coulomb interaction two times the \ac{X} energy with respect to the ground energy $2 \cdot E_X$ is not equals $E_{XX}$ but differs by the binding energy $E_B$.
The laser is therefore tuned to 
\begin{equation}
E_P = E_X - E_B / 2
\end{equation}
Empirically $E_B \approx \SI{3.78}{\milli \electronvolt}$ for \ac{GaAs} \acp{QD}.
Resonant two-photon absorption is a third-order non-linear effect which involves two photons and electrons at once.
It depends on the third-order-susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ of \ac{GaAs} and therefore requires relatively high laser power.

As this two-level system is driven in resonance its population exhibits Rabi oscillations.
The final population of the \ac{XX} can be described by
\begin{equation}
N_{XX} = \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
with $\theta$ as the pulse area in relation to the Rabi oscillations.
