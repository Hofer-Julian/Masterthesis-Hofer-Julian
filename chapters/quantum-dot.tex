\chapter{Droplet etched gallium arsenide quantum dots}
\label{chapter:quantum-dot}

\section{Fabrication and optical properties}

Quantum dots (\acs{QD}) are nanostructures which confine the motion of electrons and holes in all three spatial dimensions.
Confinement results in discrete energy levels, which is why \acp{QD} are sometimes referred to as \textit{artificial atoms}.
The discussion in this section is based on the PhD thesis of \textcite{huber_gaas_2019} and on the master's thesis of \textcite{schimpf_towards_2017}.

Gallium arsenide \acp{QD} investigated within this master's thesis are grown by \ac{MBE} with the self-assembled nanodrill technology described in the work of \textcite{wang_nanoholes_2007}.
As displayed in figure~\ref{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}a the Al forms droplets on Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As after evaporation.
The Al reacts with Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As, etching nanoholes into the surface.
Under ideal conditions, these nanoholes are highly symmetric resulting into \acp{QD} with high in-plane symmetry  as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}b.
The next step is the annealing process in which GaAs is deposited to fill the nanoholes.
The \ac{QD} is finalized by capping the layer with Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As acting as top barrier.

Compared to the band gap of the host material Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As of \SI{1.92}{\electronvolt} at room temperature, the core of the \ac{QD}, GaAs has a band gap of only \SI{1.42}{\electronvolt} at room temperature.
The energy difference between the bandgaps and the discrete energy levels forming in the \ac{QD} are responsible for the $3$D confinement and the type-I band alignment depicted in figure~\ref{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}c.
Inside of the \ac{QD}, optical transitions are possible.
Transitions between the first energy level in the \ac{CB} and the \ac{VB}, often called the s-shell, are here of special interest.
The carriers involved are the electrons ($e^-$) and the holes ($h^+$) left behind.
These are fermions and therefore only up to two of them can, in accordance with Pauli's exclusion principle, occupy a single energy state.
Electrons and holes are strongly localized inside the \ac{QD} by the confinment potential and influence each other by Coulomb attraction and exchange interaction~\cite{bimberg_quantum_1999}.
This leads to multi-particle complexes with the most fundamental being the \acf{X}, a quasi-particle consisting of an electron and a hole, bound by Coulomb interaction.
Fully occupied s-shells form the \acf{XX}, consisting of two electrons and two holes of opposite spins.

	\label{fig:droplet-etched-gaas-qds}
\end{figure}
In a \ac{QD}, polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated via a biexciton-exciton decay cascade~\cite{stevenson_semiconductor_2006}, illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:biexciton-exciton-cascade}.
The $\ket{XX}$ state forms a full shell, which means that the total angular momentum projection along the quantization axis of the \ac{XX} complex sums up to $M=0$.
The \ac{QD} is radially symmetric, therefore $M$ is preserved and $\ket{M}$ are eigenstates of the system.
After exciting the \ac{QD} into the $\ket{XX}$ state (e.g. by optical pumping) it decays by spontaneous recombination of an electron-hole-pair accompanied by the emission of a single photon into the $\ket{X}$ state.
\newpage
The two dipole-allowed radiative transitions lead to only two possible angular momentum states of the exciton:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\ket{-1}$ under emission of a right-circularly-polarized photon $\ket{R_{XX}}$
	\item $\ket{+1}$ under emission of a left-circularly-polarized photon $\ket{L_{XX}}$
\end{itemize}
$\ket{-1}$ and $\ket{+1}$ are degenerated in energy and decay into the groundstate $\ket{G}$ under emission of $\ket{L_X}$ and $\ket{R_X}$, respectively.
The resulting two-photon state is then described by
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi^+}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{L_{XX}}\ket{R_X}+\ket{R_{XX}\ket{L_X}}\right)
\end{equation}
which is one of the four Bell states, representing the maximal entangled two-particle states.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/quantum-dot/biexciton-exciton-cascade}
	\caption{Biexciton-exciton cascade in a QD.

	\label{fig:biexciton-exciton-cascade}
\end{figure}

In order to calculate the life time of the \ac{X} and \ac{XX} states and the respective spectral description of the emission the radiative transition rate $\Gamma$ between quantum mechanical states has to be derived.
$\Gamma$ describes the transition probability per unit time from an initial state $\ket{i}$ to a final state $\ket{f}$ and can be calculated by Fermi's golden rule if the the transition occurs because of a weak perturbation.
In the dipole approximation it depends on
\begin{equation}
\Gamma \propto \left|\braket{f|\mathbf{e}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{p}}|i}\right|^2 \delta(E_i-E_f-E_P)
\end{equation}
with $\mathbf{e}$ as the unit polarisation vector of the emission, $\mathbf{\hat{p}}$ as the momentum operator of the electron and $E_f$, $E_i$ and $E_P$ as the energies of the final state, of the initial state and of the emitted photon respectively.
The rate equation for the population of the initial state can then be described by
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = - \Gamma N_i(t)
\end{equation}
which results into a potential decays as solution
\begin{equation}
N_i(t) = N_i(0)e^{-t/\tau}
\end{equation}
where the lifetime of the initial state is defined as $\tau = 1/\Gamma$.

This can be applied for the \ac{X} and \ac{XX} states with decay constants $\tau_\nu$ and intensity for the emitted light $I_\nu(t)$ where $\nu \in \{X,XX\}$.
The Fourier transformation of the electric field yields a Cauchy distribution
\begin{equation}
I_{\nu}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi\tau_\nu}\frac{1}{(\omega-\omega_\nu)^2+\left(\frac{1}{2\tau_\nu}\right)^2}
\end{equation}
with $\omega_\nu=e_\nu/\hbar$ as its center frequency.


\section{Fine structur splitting}

Fine structure splitting (\acs{FSS}) in a \ac{QD} describes the energy splitting between the two possible bright $\ket{X}$ states.
In GaAs it originates from the exchange interaction between electrons and holes.~\cite{bayer_fine_2002}.
The electron-hole exchange Hamilton is described by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hamiltonian}
\mathcal{H}_{ex} = - \sum_{i=x,y,z}a_i J_{h,i}S_{e_i}+b_i J^3_{h_i}S_{e_i}
\end{equation}
with $a_i$ and $b_i$ as the spin-coupling constants, $J_{h_i}$ as the holes' and $S_{e_i}$ the electrons' total angular momentum.
The $z$-direction is assigned as the crystal growth direction and the bright \ac{X} states are defined by the projections of $J_{h_i}$ and  $S_{e_i}$ to the $z$-axis, so that $\ket{+1} =\ket{+\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\ket{-1}=\ket{-\frac{3}{2},+\frac{1}{2}}$.
The Hamiltonian of equation~\eqref{eq:hamiltonian} can then by described in the bases $\{\ket{+1},\ket{-1}\}$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{ex}=
\begin{pmatrix}
\braket{+1|\mathcal{H_{ex}}|+1} & \braket{+1|\mathcal{H_{ex}}|-1} \\
\braket{-1|\mathcal{H_{ex}}|+1} & \braket{-1|\mathcal{H_{ex}}|-1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\Delta_0 & \Delta_1 \\
\Delta_1 & \Delta_0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta_0=\frac{3}{4}(a_z+\frac{9}{4}b_z)$ and $\Delta_1=-\frac{3}{8}(b_x-b_y)$.

In the ideal case the \ac{QD} is perfectly symmetric along the $z$-axis, $b_x=b_y$, $\Delta_1$ vanishes and $\ket{+1}$ and $\ket{-1}$ are degenerate eigenstates.
If that is not the case, the angular momentum $M$ along the $z$-direction is not preserved and $\ket{+1}$ and $\ket{-1}$ are no eigenstates of $\mathcal{H}_{ex}$.
The new basis can be found by diagonalising $\mathcal{H}_{ex}$ and are described by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{+1}+\ket{-1})$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{+1}-\ket{-1})$.
In figure~\ref{fig:qd-energy-levels-fss} the $\ket{XX}$ decay path with splitted $\ket{X}$ eigenstates is shown.  $\ket{XX}$ exhibit no splitting as the angular momentum of the electrons and holes add to zero and therefore no exchange interaction occurs.
In figure~\ref{fig:fss-pol} photo-luminescence spectra recorded with a linear polariser are shown.

\section{Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband}
\label{sec:zero-phonon-side-band}
The excitonic emission of GaAs \acp{QD} exhibits non-Lorentzian asymmetric broadening.
These side bands can be traced back to a coupling to acoustic phonons \cite{peter_phonon_2004}\cite{reigue_probing_2017}.
The discussion of \acp{PSB} is based on the works of \textcite{friedrich_photochemical_1984} and  \textcite{peter_phonon_2004}.

Figure~\ref{fig:line-shape} displays a schematic representation of the \ac{ZPL} and \ac{PSB} absorption spectrum.
The intensity distribution between the two components depends strongly on temperature.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/quantum-dot/Line-shape}
	\caption[Absorption line shape of an electronic excitation.]{Absorption line shape of an electronic excitation.
		The emission shape can be determined by mirroring the absorption shape at $\omega'$.}
	\label{fig:line-shape}
\end{figure}
To determine the frequency gap $\Delta$ in figure~\ref{fig:line-shape}, the \ac{FCP}~\cite{franck_elementary_1926} are used.
The \ac{FCP} state that electronic transition between ground and excited state is much faster than the motion in the lattice as the photons carry nearly no momentum.
Hence, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates $q_i$ during the energy transitions as depicted in figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram}.
The transitions can be displayed as vertical arrows with the shorter arrow describing the \ac{ZPL} and the longer one describing the \ac{PSB}.
According to the \ac{FCP}, the more the wave functions of two vibrational energy levels overlap, the likelier is the electronic transition between these two.
In the case of figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram} this occurs when the photon energy equals to the energy difference $E_1-E_0$ plus three quanta of vibrational energy $E_{pi} = \hbar \Omega_i$.
The emission follows the same principle.

	\caption{Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband.~\cite{noauthor_zero-phonon_nodate}}
	\label{fig:zero-phonon-line-phonon-side-band}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram} and \ref{fig:lattice-modes} implicitly assume approximations in addition to the \ac{FCP}.
The lattice vibrational mode has to be well described by a quantum harmonic oscillator.
Additionally, it is assumed that only the lowest lattice vibration is excited and that the harmonic oscillator potentials are equal in both states.
These preconditions are visible in the parabolic shaped potential wells and equally spaced phonon energy levels in figure~\ref{fig:phonon-energy-diagram}.

The reason why the \ac{ZPL} is stronger than the \ac{PSB} can be found by examining the superpositon of the lattice modes.
Each lattice mode $m$ leads to a different energy difference $\hbar \Omega_m$ between phonons.
That is why the transitions with phonons result in a energy distribution and the zero-phonon transition add up at the electronic origin $E_1 - E_0$ as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:lattice-modes}b.

\newpage

The theoretical limit of the spectral range of the zero-phonon line for a GaAs quantum dot can be calculated with the time-energy uncertainty relation
\begin{equation}
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t = \frac{h}{2 \pi}
\end{equation}
This gives for typical lifetime of a GaAs quantum dot of $\Delta t = \SI{250}{\pico \second}$
\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \SI{2.64}{\micro \electronvolt}.
\end{equation}
The frequency uncertainty can be obtained through
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:planck-einstein}
\Delta \nu = \frac{\Delta E}{h}.
\end{equation}
The wavelength $\lambda$ relates to $\nu$ with the Planck-Einstein relation
\begin{equation}
\lambda(\nu) = \frac{c}{\nu}
\end{equation}
and the wavelength uncertainty $\Delta \lambda$ can be approximated with a Taylor series around $\nu_0$
\begin{align}
\Delta \lambda = - \lambda'(\nu_0)\cdot \Delta \nu.
\end{align}
With equation~\eqref{eq:planck-einstein} and the center wavelength of the zero-phonon line $\lambda_{0}$ in table~\ref{tab:quantum-dot-emission} this gives
\begin{align}
\Delta \lambda &= \frac{c}{\nu_0^2} \cdot \Delta \nu = \frac{\lambda_0^2}{c}\cdot\Delta \nu\\
\label{eq:zero-phonon-theoretical-limit}
&\approx \SI{1.0}{\pico \metre}
\end{align}

Together with data from \textcite{scholl_resonance_2019} and empirical values measured by our group, this leads to the parameters listed in table~\ref{tab:quantum-dot-emission}.

\section{Optical excitation of a quantum dot}
In this section, the different ways of optically exciting \acp{QD} are discussed.
It is based on the PhD thesis of \textcite{huber_gaas_2019} and the master's thesis of \textcite{schimpf_towards_2017}.
The excited states of a \ac{QD} can be populated in various ways.
A common way is above-band excitation, depicted in figure~\ref{fig:optical-pumping-quantum-dot}a.
Electrons are optically excited by a laser with energies above the band gap of the \acp{QD} host material Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As with $E_L = \SI{1.92}{\electronvolt}$ at room temperature.
Subsequently, electrons and holes are captured by the \acp{QD} and relax via phonon-scattering to the lowest energy level, the s-shell.
However, because of pronounced recapture processes~\cite{kuroda_symmetric_2013} and spin scattering processes~\cite{michler_single_2009}, above-band excitation is not favourable for entangled photon generation.
Additionally, indistinguishability of the emitted photons is reduced because of fluctuating electric fields.
Resonant excitation of electron-hole pairs provides an alternative which is less affected by fluctuating electric fields.
As shown in figure~\ref{fig:optical-pumping-quantum-dot}b this technique creates electron-hole-pairs directly in the s-shell.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/quantum-dot/optical-pumping-quantum-dot}
	\caption{Optical pumping of a QD by	(a) above-band excitation and (b) resonant excitation~\cite{huber_gaas_2019}}
	\label{fig:optical-pumping-quantum-dot}
\end{figure}
Resonant excitation can be used in order to populate the $\ket{XX}$ state with near unity population probability~\cite{reindl_phonon-assisted_2017}.
Due to dipole-selection rules, this requires a two-photon-absorption process.
Hereby, the energy of a femtosecond-pulse laser $E_p$ is tuned to exactly the half of the \ac{XX} energy with respect to the ground energy, as sketched in figure~\ref{fig:qd-resonant}.
Because of Coulomb interaction, two times the \ac{X} energy with respect to the ground energy $2 \cdot E_X$ is not equal to $E_{XX}$ but differs by the binding energy $E_B$.
The laser is therefore tuned to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:e_p}
E_P = E_X - E_B / 2
\end{equation}
with empirically $E_B \approx \SI{3.78}{\milli \electronvolt}$ for GaAs \acp{QD}.
Resonant two-photon absorption is a third-order non-linear effect which involves two photons and electrons at once.
It depends on the third-order-susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ of GaAs and therefore requires relatively high laser power.

As this two-level system is driven in resonance its population exhibits Rabi oscillations.
The final population of the \ac{XX} can be described by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:n-xx}
N_{XX} = \sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
with $\theta$ as the pulse area in relation to the Rabi oscillations.
It has to be noted that $\theta$ is not the area of the excitation pulse, but depends on it in a non-trivial way~\cite{stufler_two-photon_2006}.
Measured Rabi oscillations of \ac{X} and \ac{XX} are shown in figure~\ref{fig:rabi-oscillations}~\cite{reindl_phonon-assisted_2017}.
Theoretically, the curve should oscillate between occupancies $N/N_0$, with $N_0$ as the maximum population, of $0$ and $1$.
However, as a consequence of phonon damping the occupancy converges to a purely probabilistic value of $0.5$~\cite{forstner_phonon-assisted_2003}.

\end{figure}
\section{Single photon emission}
The XX-X cascade shown in figure~\ref{fig:qd-resonant} results in a single photon pair per emission cycle.
Single photons are necessary for quantum cryptography and quantum optics in general which motivates the following discussion of this topic based on the thesis of \textcite{huber_gaas_2019}.
The single photon purity of the $\ket{XX}$ to $\ket{X}$ and the $\ket{X}$ to $\ket{G}$ decay emissions, respectively, can be determined by performing a \acf{HBT} experiment.
An example of an \ac{HBT} setup is shown in figure~\ref{fig:hbt-fiber} and consists of two \acp{APD} used as single photon detectors and a beam splitter.
The measurements at the two detectors can be used in order to calculate the second-order correlation function
\begin{equation}
g^{(2)} = \frac{\langle n_1(t) n_2(t+\tau)\rangle}{\langle n_1(t) \rangle \langle n_2(t+\tau) \rangle}
\end{equation}
where $n_i(t)$ is the number of counts registered on \ac{APD} $i$ at time $t$ and $\tau$ is the time delay. When a single photon enters the input of the \ac{BS} it can only be measured at one output, but never at both simultaneously.
Assuming a perfect single photon emitter, a coincidence measurement between \ac{APD}~$1$ and \ac{APD}~$2$ will result in $g^{(2)}(\tau=0) = 0$.
Subsequently, side peaks are expected at $\tau_s=z/R$ with $R$ as the repetition rate of the laser and $z\in \mathbb{Z}\backslash \{0\}$.
The single photon purity can then be defined as
\begin{equation}
\kappa(b) = \frac{A_0(b)}{A_s(b)}
\end{equation}
with $A_0$ as the area under $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ around $\tau=0$ and $A_s$ as the average area under the side peaks at $\tau_s$.
The time bin $b$ has to be chosen so that it includes a full side peak.
If $b$ would be chosen too small it would falsely increase $\kappa$, if chosen too high it includes unnecessary much noise.
