\contentsline {todo}{Zusammenfassung nach Abstract anpassen}{}{section*.5}
\contentsline {todo}{Very daring statement. Weaken it a bit}{}{section*.7}
\contentsline {todo}{The detailed outlook over the chapters should be part of the introduction, not of the abstract. Rewrite the abstract to give a brief overlook over all the work you did.}{}{section*.8}
\contentsline {todo}{Citations. In general: The introduction should be quite citation heavy}{1}{section*.13}
\contentsline {todo}{Motivate more (+citations): Quantum repeater schemes for a "quantum internet" (cite Marcus teleportation paper), quantum computer, etc. There is so many fancy stuff QDs could cover, you mentioned the most boring one which can be done even with attenuated lasers (QKD). Also, compare with other sources: Spontaneous parametric downconverters, cold atoms. Nitrogen vacancies in diamonds (Cite like hell)}{1}{section*.14}
\contentsline {todo}{Explain the figures of merit necessary for these applications: Indistinguishability and Entanglement. To this point, the reader has no idea what these terms mean. Only after then you can start introducing dots as good sources for meeting these demands.}{1}{section*.15}
\contentsline {todo}{keep the FSS details for the QD chapter. (Introduce this chaper, as you did with chapter 3 and 4) It's too special for the introduction and actually irrelevant for your topics. Focus on the two-photon excitation and keep it as simple as possible for the introductin. Imaging beeing a reader with minor knowledge about QDs.}{1}{section*.17}
\contentsline {todo}{Please reformulate. This sounds "inverted". Start with what a Fabry-Perot is and that it does what we want.}{2}{section*.19}
\contentsline {todo}{Fermi's golden rulse}{4}{section*.26}
\contentsline {todo}{Describe it better (with some math)}{5}{section*.28}
\contentsline {todo}{General comment: It's good to include seminal papers from earlier decades, as you do. But please give state-of-the-art paper references in addition (I can help you with that). Imaging beeing a future reader and you have to work yourself through the chain of citations, it's very painful.}{6}{section*.30}
\contentsline {todo}{Is it equivalent to say that the photons carry nearly no momentum? \textbf {Answer: Yes}}{7}{section*.34}
\contentsline {todo}{Here again: Summarize in the caption what we see. This is too little.}{8}{section*.36}
\contentsline {todo}{Introduce a chapter "Methods" (I would say between chapter QDs and ARP) and decribe some basics how you measure stuff, such as micro-PL, the cryostat etc}{13}{section*.45}
\contentsline {todo}{Here I miss details about the measurement strategy. Explain why we measured such a short pulse. The goal was expanding much longer pulses for the final ARP. Go deeper here.}{23}{section*.59}
\contentsline {todo}{Conclusion? What can we do to overcome this in the future? }{24}{section*.62}
\contentsline {todo}{where do this elements come from and which basis is used by this matrix formalism. Without these definitions, these letters mean nothing.}{28}{section*.65}
\contentsline {todo}{I think this is not the scanning mode. The scanning mode is when the piezo moves fast back and forth, and not stepwise. Look it up in the literature please. (look at Firefox tab)}{42}{section*.79}
\contentsline {todo}{Better: 4.5 Setup and Measurement General stuff 4.5.1 Scanning mode with fast photodiodes 4.5.2 Stepwise mode (find better name) with CCD}{43}{section*.81}
\contentsline {todo}{1) What APDs, which time resolution 2) What scanning frequency and why 3) Show pictures of the measurement itself and discribe features, errors etc. 5) What time range did you define, how did you configure the correlation hardware. 4) We did not connect the TTL-Output of the Funky-Generator directly to the Hydraharp, as it uses a different standard (NIM).}{43}{section*.83}
\contentsline {todo}{how does this work. Explain more details, this is not trivial}{44}{section*.87}
\contentsline {todo}{What does this comparison tell us? Did it fit the calculation? Where are the side peaks we saw in the HeNe measurement? What a about the stability? Are there calculations, expected temperature drifts, etc. Are there differences between the expected Finesse and the measured one, and why? Is this expected?}{45}{section*.89}
\contentsline {todo}{Don't refer all the time to the main text. Imagine I'm a reader from a different field. I read the abstract, the introduction and the summary/outlook. Now I should know what you did and why and what are the future plans. At this point I have no idea what MOSAIC is, I have no idea what a pulse expander is, etc. unless you give me a hint in the summary.}{47}{section*.91}
