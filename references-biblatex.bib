	abstract = {A biexciton in a semiconductor quantum dot is a source of polarization-entangled photons with high potential for implementation in scalable systems. Several approaches for non-resonant, resonant and quasi-resonant biexciton preparation exist, but all have their own disadvantages, for instance low fidelity, timing jitter, incoherence or sensitivity to experimental parameters. We demonstrate a coherent and robust technique to generate a biexciton in an {InGaAs} quantum dot with a fidelity close to one. The main concept is the application of rapid adiabatic passage to the ground state-exciton-biexciton system. We reinforce our experimental results with simulations which include a microscopic coupling to phonons.},

	abstract = {Photonic quantum technologies call for scalable quantum light sources that can be integrated, while providing the end user with single and entangled photons on-demand. One promising candidate are strain free {GaAs}/{AlGaAs} quantum dots obtained by droplet etching. Such quantum dots exhibit ultra low multi-photon probability and an unprecedented degree of photon pair entanglement. However, different to commonly studied {InGaAs}/{GaAs} quantum dots obtained by the Stranski-Krastanow mode, photons with a near-unity indistinguishability from these quantum emitters have proven to be elusive so far. Here, we show on-demand generation of near-unity indistinguishable photons from these quantum emitters by exploring pulsed resonance fluorescence. Given the short intrinsic lifetime of excitons confined in the {GaAs} quantum dots, we show single photon indistinguishability with a raw visibility of \$V\_\{raw\}=(94.2{\textbackslash}pm5.2){\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$, without the need for Purcell enhancement. Our results represent a milestone in the advance of {GaAs} quantum dots by demonstrating the final missing property standing in the way of using these emitters as a key component in quantum communication applications, e.g. as an entangled source for quantum repeater architectures.},

We derive the generic Airy distribution of a Fabry-Pérot resonator, which equals the internal resonance enhancement factor, and show that all related Airy distributions are obtained by simple scaling factors. We analyze the textbook approaches to the Fabry-Pérot resonator and point out various misconceptions. We verify that the sum of the mode profiles of all longitudinal modes is the fundamental physical function that characterizes the Fabry-Pérot resonator and generates the Airy distribution. Consequently, the resonator losses are quantified by the linewidths of the underlying Lorentzian lines and not by the measured Airy linewidth. Therefore, we introduce the Lorentzian finesse which provides the spectral resolution of the Lorentzian lines, whereas the usually considered Airy finesse only quantifies the performance of the Fabry-Pérot resonator as a scanning spectrometer. We also point out that the concepts of linewidth and finesse of the Airy distribution of a Fabry-Pérot resonator break down at low reflectivity. Furthermore, we show that a Fabry-Pérot resonator has no cut-off resonance wavelength. Finally, we investigate the influence of frequency-dependent mirror reflectivities, allowing for the direct calculation of its deformed mode profiles.},

In this period of time the concept of spookily interacting quantum states became an emerging field of science. After various experiments proving the existence of such non-classical states, visionary ideas were put forward to exploit entanglement in quantum information science and technology. These novel concepts have not yet come out of the experimental stage, mostly because of the lack of suitable, deterministic sources of entangled quantum states. Among many systems under investigation, semiconductor quantum dots are particularly appealing emitters of on-demand, single polarization-entangled photon-pairs. Although, it was originally believed that quantum dots must exhibit a limited degree of entanglement related to numerous decoherence effects present in the solid-state. Recent studies invalidated the premise of unavoidable entanglement degrading effects. We review the relevant experiments which have led to these important discoveries and discuss the remaining challenges for the anticipated quantum technologies.},

Here, we demonstrate deterministic and robust generation of pulsed resonance ﬂuorescence single photons from a single semiconductor quantum dot using adiabatic rapid passage, a method robust against ﬂuctuation of driving pulse area and dipole moments of solid-state emitters. The emitted photons are background-free, have a vanishing two-photon emission probability of 0.3\% and a raw (corrected) two-photon Hong−Ou−Mandel interference visibility of 97.9\% (99.5\%), reaching a precision that places single photons at the threshold for fault-tolerant surface-code quantum computing. This single-photon source can be readily scaled up to multiphoton entanglement and used for quantum metrology, boson sampling, and linear optical quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots are converging towards the demanding requirements of photonic quantum technologies. Among different systems, quantum dots with dimensions exceeding the free-exciton Bohr radius are appealing because of their high oscillator strengths. While this property has received much attention in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics, little is known about the degree of indistinguishability of single photons consecutively emitted by such dots and on the proper excitation schemes to achieve high indistinguishability. A prominent example is represented by {GaAs} quantum dots obtained by local droplet etching, which recently outperformed other systems as triggered sources of entangled photon pairs. On these dots, we compare different single-photon excitation mechanisms, and we ﬁnd (i) a ”phonon bottleneck” and poor indistinguishability for conventional excitation via excited states and (ii) photon indistinguishablilities above 90\% for both strictly resonant and for incoherent acoustic- and optical-phonon-assisted excitation. Among the excitation schemes, optical phonon-assisted excitation enables straightforward laser rejection without a compromise on the source brightness together with a high photon indistinguishability.},

	abstract = {Photonic quantum technologies are on the verge of ﬁnding applications in everyday life with quantum cryptography and quantum simulators on the horizon. Extensive research has been carried out to identify suitable quantum emitters and single epitaxial quantum dots have emerged as near-optimal sources of bright, ondemand, highly indistinguishable single photons and entangled photon-pairs. In order to build up quantum networks, it is essential to interface remote quantum emitters. However, this is still an outstanding challenge, as the quantum states of dissimilar “artiﬁcial atoms” have to be prepared on-demand with high ﬁdelity and the generated photons have to be made indistinguishable in all possible degrees of freedom. Here, we overcome this major obstacle and show an unprecedented two-photon interference (visibility of 51 ± 5\%) from remote strain-tunable {GaAs} quantum dots emitting on-demand photon-pairs. We achieve this result by exploiting for the ﬁrst time the full potential of a novel phonon-assisted two-photon excitation scheme, which allows for the generation of highly indistinguishable (visibility of 71 ± 9\%) entangled photon-pairs (ﬁdelity of 90 ± 2\%), enables push-button biexciton state preparation (ﬁdelity of 80 ± 2\%) and outperforms conventional resonant two-photon excitation schemes in terms of robustness against environmental decoherence. Our results mark an important milestone for the practical realization of quantum repeaters and complex multiphoton entanglement experiments involving dissimilar artiﬁcial atoms.},

It has been demonstrated that semiconductor quantum dots ({QDs}), which exhibit a suﬃciently small excitonic ﬁne structure splitting ({FSS}) can be used as triggered, on-chip sources of polarization entangled photon pairs. As-grown {QDs} usually do not have the required values of the {FSS}, making the availability of post-growth tuning techniques highly desired. This article reviews the eﬀect of diﬀerent post-growth treatments and external ﬁelds on the {FSS} such as thermal annealing, magnetic ﬁelds, the optical Stark eﬀect, electric ﬁelds, and anisotropic stress. As a consequence of the tuning of the {FSS}, for some tuning techniques a rotation of the polarization of the emitted light is observed. The joint modiﬁcation of polarization orientation and {FSS} can be described by an anticrossing of the bright excitonic states.},

For pulses with a Gaussian proﬁle and a ﬁxed bandwidth, we derive a rigorous formula for the maximum temporal chirp rate that can be sustained by the pulse. A modiﬁed Landau-Zener formula displays clearly the relationships among the pulse parameters. This formula is used to derive the optimal conditions for eﬃcient, robust population transfer. As illustrations of the theory, we present results for two- and four-level systems, and selective vibronic excitation in the I2 molecule. We demonstrate that population transfer with chirped pulses is more robust and more selective than population transfer with transform-limited pulses.},
