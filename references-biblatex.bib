	abstract = {More than 80 years passed since the first publication on entangled quantum states. In this period of time the concept of spookily interacting quantum states became an emerging field of science. After various experiments proving the existence of such non-classical states, visionary ideas were put forward to exploit entanglement in quantum information science and technology. These novel concepts have not yet come out of the experimental stage, mostly because of the lack of suitable, deterministic sources of entangled quantum states. Among many systems under investigation, semiconductor quantum dots are particularly appealing emitters of on-demand, single polarization-entangled photon-pairs. Although, it was originally believed that quantum dots must exhibit a limited degree of entanglement related to numerous decoherence effects present in the solid-state. Recent studies invalidated the premise of unavoidable entanglement degrading effects. We review the relevant experiments which have led to these important discoveries and discuss the remaining challenges for the anticipated quantum technologies.},

Several approaches for non-resonant, resonant and quasi-resonant biexciton preparation exist, but all have their own disadvantages, for instance low fidelity, timing jitter, incoherence or sensitivity to experimental parameters. We demonstrate a coherent and robust technique to generate a biexciton in an {InGaAs} quantum dot with a fidelity close to one. The main concept is the application of rapid adiabatic passage to the ground state-exciton-biexciton system. We reinforce our experimental results with simulations which include a microscopic coupling to phonons.},

Future scalable, faulttolerant photonic quantum technologies demand both stringently high levels of photon indistinguishability and generation eﬃciency. Here, we demonstrate deterministic and robust generation of pulsed resonance ﬂuorescence single photons from a single semiconductor quantum dot using adiabatic rapid passage, a method robust against ﬂuctuation of driving pulse area and dipole moments of solid-state emitters. The emitted photons are background-free, have a vanishing two-photon emission probability of 0.3\% and a raw (corrected) two-photon Hong−Ou−Mandel interference visibility of 97.9\% (99.5\%), reaching a precision that places single photons at the threshold for fault-tolerant surface-code quantum computing. This single-photon source can be readily scaled up to multiphoton entanglement and used for quantum metrology, boson sampling, and linear optical quantum computing.},

	abstract = {We systematically characterize the Fabry-Pérot resonator. We derive the generic Airy distribution of a Fabry-Pérot resonator, which equals the internal resonance enhancement factor, and show that all related Airy distributions are obtained by simple scaling factors. We analyze the textbook approaches to the Fabry-Pérot resonator and point out various misconceptions. We verify that the sum of the mode profiles of all longitudinal modes is the fundamental physical function that characterizes the Fabry-Pérot resonator and generates the Airy distribution. Consequently, the resonator losses are quantified by the linewidths of the underlying Lorentzian lines and not by the measured Airy linewidth. Therefore, we introduce the Lorentzian finesse which provides the spectral resolution of the Lorentzian lines, whereas the usually considered Airy finesse only quantifies the performance of the Fabry-Pérot resonator as a scanning spectrometer. We also point out that the concepts of linewidth and finesse of the Airy distribution of a Fabry-Pérot resonator break down at low reflectivity. Furthermore, we show that a Fabry-Pérot resonator has no cut-off resonance wavelength. Finally, we investigate the influence of frequency-dependent mirror reflectivities, allowing for the direct calculation of its deformed mode profiles.},

	abstract = {Photonic quantum technologies call for scalable quantum light sources that can be integrated, while providing the end user with single and entangled photons on-demand. One promising candidate are strain free {GaAs}/{AlGaAs} quantum dots obtained by droplet etching. Such quantum dots exhibit ultra low multi-photon probability and an unprecedented degree of photon pair entanglement. However, different to commonly studied {InGaAs}/{GaAs} quantum dots obtained by the Stranski-Krastanow mode, photons with a near-unity indistinguishability from these quantum emitters have proven to be elusive so far. Here, we show on-demand generation of near-unity indistinguishable photons from these quantum emitters by exploring pulsed resonance fluorescence. Given the short intrinsic lifetime of excitons confined in the {GaAs} quantum dots, we show single photon indistinguishability with a raw visibility of \$V\_\{raw\}=(94.2{\textbackslash}pm5.2){\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$, without the need for Purcell enhancement. Our results represent a milestone in the advance of {GaAs} quantum dots by demonstrating the final missing property standing in the way of using these emitters as a key component in quantum communication applications, e.g. as an entangled source for quantum repeater architectures.},
